# Fully Dynamic grpc curl like dart client

it dose not require any code generation.
you can call any grpc service by either providing the proto file 
or by requesting a reflection enabled grpc service to tell you the structure you need to know.

it also takes requests as json and does all the encoding/decoding under the hood.


iam making it as a way to solve an issue in an open source project that iam interested in
still not finished but sending requests is kinda working.
