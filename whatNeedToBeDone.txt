Some Refactors and things to do:
 [x] seperate data storing from fields representation
 [] Decoding responses
 [] more validation in some places
 [x] relying on proto files importing
 [] dealing with multiple proto files imports, where there might be some type in a different file u might retrieve (next)
 [] handle metadata sending
 [] support streaming


what is made so far:
 protobuff encoding
 organizing the FileDescriptor data in a manner that can help us later to map input data
 reflection and file importing
 sending requests
 serializing json input to a proto message
 deserializing message to json (work for message definition only but will need to refactor it once we implement decoding)

what need to be done:
 proto buff decoding
 raising errors for certain cases (will probably integrate it also with the app terminal window once we integrate every thing)
 dealing with proto dependencies (i already made it but need more testing)
 handle metadata sending
 support streaming
